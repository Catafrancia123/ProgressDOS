Install Python WITH "pip", its important in the future.

% = points

Each Segment means a different thing:
Dark Blue: Safe, 5 points
Light Blue: Safe, either 10 points or 15 points
Yellow: Safe, No points, good for making patterns
Red: Dangerous, Reduces 1 life and Reset the progressbar aka Start again
Pink: Safe, Reduces 5 points
Grey: Safe, Nothing.
Green: Instant 100 points aka Instant Win
The 3 lives mean the Lives you have, if you get a red segment, you lose 1 live, if you lose all, GAME OVER!
